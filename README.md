# The Science of Conductivity


## My best attempt at simplifying the extremely complex science of conductivity.


DISCLAIMER: I'm not a quantum physicist or an expert in semiconductors or superconductors. I’m purely writing this for practice and fun, mostly to refresh my own knowledge on the subject. My goal is to create something to share with others who don't want to wade through convoluted quantum physics manuals to understand the fundamental advancement that led to modern computing.

I’ll do my best to divide this well and categorize everything... but don’t bet on it. ;)

# Semiconductors – The History


The history of semiconductors traces back to the early 19th century, laying the foundation for modern electronics. This journey began with the discovery of electrical properties in certain materials. In 1821, Thomas Johann Seebeck observed the thermoelectric effect, where heat applied to certain materials generated a voltage. Later, Michael Faraday and others investigated conductivity in materials like silver sulfide and selenium.

The term "semiconductor" was formally introduced in the mid-20th century, but its significance surged with the invention of the transistor in 1947 by John Bardeen, Walter Brattain, and William Shockley at Bell Labs. This pivotal breakthrough replaced bulky vacuum tubes and heralded the era of compact, efficient electronic devices. Silicon emerged as a preferred material due to its abundance and superior electronic properties. In 1958, Jack Kilby of Texas Instruments developed the first integrated circuit, a major milestone that enabled the miniaturization of electronic systems.

Over decades, the semiconductor industry witnessed exponential growth, driven by Moore's Law, which predicted the doubling of transistors on a chip roughly every two years. This advancement led to the creation of microprocessors, memory chips, and other critical components powering computers, smartphones, and countless modern devices. Today, semiconductors are at the heart of cutting-edge technologies such as artificial intelligence, 5G, and quantum computing, shaping the future of innovation and connectivity.

Moore's Law is an observation made by Gordon Moore, co-founder of Intel. He predicted that the number of transistors on microchips would double every two years, while the cost per transistor would decrease.

In recent years, Moore's Law has slowed due to the approaching physical limitations of transistors. Over five decades, we’ve gone from talking about millimeters to nanometers—an incredible feat of human engineering.

Now, you may think to yourself, why can't we just... go smaller? That’s a great question, but answering it requires delving into quantum physics.

# Quantum Physics and How It Affects Conductivity


If you’re not familiar with quantum physics yet (and I can’t blame you), let me take some time to explain the basics.

Throw everything you think you know about physics out the window. Paradoxes? Impossibilities? Welcome to quantum physics.

## Wave-particle duality

This shows us that matter can exist as both a particle and a wave at the exact same time. Sound like nonsense? Pretty much.

This applies to tiny particles like electrons, which sometimes behave as particles and other times as waves. This explains phenomena like light diffraction.


## Superposition

A particle can exist in multiple states or places simultaneously—but only as long as we don’t measure it. Once observed, the particle collapses into a definite state.

This principle is used in quantum computers to create qubits—a bit that can be 1, 0, or any value in between, all at the same time.


## Entanglement

Two particles can become linked, or entangled, so that the state of one instantly affects the state of the other, even over vast distances. This is another key to quantum computing.


## Uncertainty

Heisenberg’s Uncertainty Principle states that we can’t know both the position and velocity of a particle simultaneously. The more precisely we measure one, the less precisely we know the other.


Now that you know the basics, how does this tie into transistors and computing?
